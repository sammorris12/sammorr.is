Over the past six months I’ve been gradually entering sentences into my phone with a view to publishing them on a blog. Every time I got close to posting one of these thoughts, I was reminded of a conversation with a friend where we both developed a fear of blogging through a fear of being wrong. I presume this comes from most design writing sounding so sure of itself.

However, one of the most important lessons I’ve learnt as a designer is letting go of that fear of being wrong. There’s only so much I can gain from Twitter, [Branch](http://www.branch.com/) (when it had discovery) and lessons learnt at work. So it’s time to overcome that fear again.

Oh, and I realise how much of a bad omen it is to start a blog with a meta-post about the blog you’re starting. I look forward to this being the only article in the “archives” in a few months time.
