The Londonerâ€™s bus departure board, Bustle was the result of my first foray into proper API and mobile development. Using TFL data, Bustle finds stops near you and will display the arrival times quicker and cleaner than any other app on the App Store.

Bustle was released for iOS on the 4th of December 2012
